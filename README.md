# dash.js fork

This repository is a fork of [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) v4.6.0,
due to some reason, this repository was not suitable to be public when started,
so the forking process is not done on GitHub, which forces the fork to be public.

The fork is for educational purposes only.

The original README of dash.js can be found [here](./README.md).
